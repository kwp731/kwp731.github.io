<p>Terezi Pyrope is a blind troll with an obsession for JUSTICE.
 She lives in a tree and loves to play computer games with her other troll friends. With the help of her scalemates (her dragon plush toys)
 she can solve any mystery! In the Alternian Judicial system, the defendant is guilty until proven innocent. It is more important for justice
 to be served than it is for the accused to actually have been correctly selected. There is an obvious choice when it comes to serving justice
 in the court of law, DEATH!
